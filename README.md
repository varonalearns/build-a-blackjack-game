# Build a Blackjack game

## Summary
This is my solution to Build a Blackjack lesson from The Frontend Developer Career Path that can be found on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). I personalized the CSS and tried to implement a feature where the game asks for the player's name. 

While working on this project, I learned the following:
- arrays
- objects
- booleans
- if else statements
- comparison operators
- logical operators
- for loops
- The Math object
- return statements

## Continued Development
I would like to return to this project when I have more time and flesh out the following:
- Have the game reset if the players loses or wins.
- Implement a feature where the user can enter their name.
- Have chips be increased or decreased based on wins and losses.
- A win and fail state that is triggered when the player loses or wins.
